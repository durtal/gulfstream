<div class="container"> <h1>Ratings</h1> <p>Ratings found here belong to horses who have raced, more than once in Claiming races, at Gulfstream Park from December 2012 onwards. Not all horses in that time have been handicapped, but the vast majority ({{ horses.length}} to be precise) have been.</p> <p>The ratings are based on the performance in the type/class of race the horse competed in, so winners of a Grade 3 may have a similar rating to a winner of a Maiden Claiming. Going into 2015 I hope to vastly improve the ratings and distinguish the difference between these two winners, so these ratings are very much a work in progress. For a detailed overview of how these ratings have been arrived at, including a look at issues/compromises/flaws, then please read the <a ui-sref="ratings.handicappingmethod">Handicapping Method</a> tab below.</p> <p>Winners ratings for a particular class of race will average to 0, with impressive winners earning ratings in the high teens, low twenties. When viewing the record for an individual horse the <strong>CoR</strong> heading will indicate the class of race, more details about these groups is found in the <a ui-sref="ratings.handicappingmethod">Handicapping Method</a> post.</p> <p>After clicking on the <a ui-sref="ratings.all">Gulfstream Ratings</a> tab a small table with the available horses should show up these can be filtered by name.
