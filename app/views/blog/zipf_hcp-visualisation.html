	<h2>Intro</h2>
	<p>This post walks through the method of race standardisation used in creating the ratings found in this app, it was first explained by Simon Rowlands, of <a href="https://www.timeform.com/racing/">Timeform</a>, find his article explaining the method <a href="https://betting.betfair.com/horse-racing/bloggers/simon-rowlands/simon-rowlands-on-handicapping-060710.html">here</a>.  There is a brief explanation in this post, but <a href="https://angularjs.org">AngularJS</a> and <a href="http://d3js.org">D3</a> are used to create an interactive visualisation that attempts to show the method <strong>at work</strong>.</p>

	<h2>zipf_hcp</h2>
	<p>One of the more complex functions in my <a href="https://github.com/durtal/RcappeR">RcappeR</a> package is that of <code>zipf_hcp</code>, this is an attempt to visualise what the function does.  Using both <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> and <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3</a> to create an interactive visualisation that will hopefully help show the function at work, and how different inputs affect the output.  The package includes a help page on the function, find it <a href="http://durtal.github.io/RcappeR/zipf_hcp.html">here</a>, it also has a specific vignette, find that <a href="http://durtal.github.io/RcappeR/handicap_with_zipf_hcp.html">here</a>.</p>
