    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>This web app contains ratings for individual horses who have raced at Gulfstream
        Park from December 2012 onwards.</p>

    <p>Ratings have been created using data collected from a variety of sources. With the data collected,
        the bulk of the work has been carried out using the <strong><a href="http://cran.r-project.org/">R</a></strong>
        programming language and a package I created called <strong>RcappeR</strong>, which will eventually be available on
        <a href="#">github</a> for others to use.  I hope that ratings found here, and posts
        that will walk through my handicapping process will encourage others to use the package, offer suggestions, improvements,
        alternatives, and to share with other race fans.</p>

    <p>It was June 2013 that I started to learn R on my old wordpress blog, I also knew very little HTML and CSS, just enough to
        highlight some clumsy R code.  At the time I had no idea I would end up with a web app like this (which is still very much a work in progress).
          I have taken advantage of a lot of open source software in the creation, storage, saving, building, and presentation of the ratings/analysis
        found in these pages.  The primary software I have used includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><a href="http://cran.r-project.org/" target="_blank">R</a></strong> - programming language</li>
        <li><strong><a href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a></strong> - version control,
            <strong><a href="http://github.com" target="_blank">Github</a></strong> also hosts this app</li>
        <li><strong><a href="http://www.mongodb.org/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a></strong> - database</li>
        <li><strong><a href="http://angularjs.org" target="_blank">AngularJS</a></strong> - web app framework</li>
        <li><strong><a href="http://yeoman.io/" target="_blank">Yeoman</a></strong> - web app scaffolding tool,
            uses 2 more open source tools, <a href="http://gruntjs.com/" target="_blank">GruntJS</a> and
            <a href="http://bower.io/" target="_blank">Bower</a></li>
    </ul>
