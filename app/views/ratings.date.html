        <sub>The range of ratings goes from 0 to 130, the highest rated performance by any horse is Dreaming Of Julia, who rated 127 when winning on the <a ui-sref="ratings.date.race({ raceDate: '30/03/13', raceId: '8' })">30/3/13</a>, performance ratings sometimes drop below 0, but are ignored in these plots.  The strength of a card could be seen via the distribution of ratings; lesser cards, probably midweek containing Maiden Claimers and Claimers, will have a distribution toward the lower end of the range, strong cards, probably Saturdays with plenty of Stakes races, such as the card Dreaming Of Julia ran on, will have a distribution toward the upper end of the histogram.</sub>
