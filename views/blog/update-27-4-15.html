<h2>App Update - 27/04/15</h2> <p>This app contains ratings for ~2000 horses who have raced at Gulfstream Park at least 5 times since December 2012. Those horses who have raced fewer than 5 times have been awarded ratings, but don't feature in the app, until now.</p> <p>Rather than populate the app with upwards of 10,000 horses, I have (for the time being at least) endeavoured to make the performance ratings for every race available. These races can be reached either viewing the profile page of a horse who has raced 5 times, and clicking on the <strong>date</strong> or <strong>race</strong> values in a horses record. Or if the user knows the date and or race, then the URL follows the convention:</p> <h4>durtal.github.io/gulfstream/#/ratings/date/<code>{raceDate}</code>/race/<code>{raceId}</code></h4> <p>Where <code>{raceDate}</code> is the race date in the format <strong>dd</strong>%252F<strong>mm</strong>%252F<strong>yy</strong>, and the <code>{raceId}</code> is the race number on the race card. The URL is a little ugly, relying on %252F (the url encoding of backslash), to type in manually, this is due to the format I have stored the dates in (as dd/mm/yy) locally, not envisaging I would be using it as in URL. I hope to update in time.</p> <p>Once getting to a date on which there were races, depending on the device you are using, you will see a table of the winners on that day as well as their ratings and links to view the individual races. If you are using a larger device you should also see a histogram displaying the performance ratings for horses to have run on that day. An example is shown below:</p> <img class="img-responsive" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/durtal/gulfstream/1b4664861a2a1c8cac52ab32d26129391e60b826/app/images/race_views.png">
